## **Introduction**

There are platforms such as google reviews, that is incorporated into google maps, where people can give their opinions about businesses in multiple areas. Today these tools are of vital importance for companies, which are able to gather information about their customers perspective to improve performance, analyze local utilities, find faults, and carry out other studies that allow made important decisions for the business.

In this project, based on data obtained from google maps, we seek to develop solutions for a conglomerate of restaurant companies and related businesses in the United States. The solutions will be oriented both to facilitate a better analysis of the reviews, and of growing business areas, as well as to the creation of  tools for make recommendations for users, and for advice on the creation of new stores taking into account the tourist market.

To put these objectives into practice, multiple technological tools will be used for storage, acces and management of data, as well as for the creation of graphs and other analysis tools.

## **Problem Statement**

A conglomerate of restaurants and companies in the United States wants to take advantage of the information collected by Google Maps on customer ratings and reviews to improve its business plan. for this purpose, the conglomerate requests that solutions be provided to the next points: obtain a detailed analysis of the available reviews of businesses related to tourism and gastronomy, which will allow them to improve their premises to obtain better public acceptance. It is also requested to predict which are the lines of business in which there will be an increase in demand, as well as in which sectors it would be convenient to create new stores. Finally, a tool is also requested that offers a recommendation service to users, introducing them to new restaurants.

## Objectives

- Detailed analysis of the opinion of users in Google Maps on businesses related to tourism and leisure.

- Sentiment analysis, to predict which will be the business items that will grow (or decline) the most.

According to 'Share America', 'ThoughtCo' and 'Vivaturist'; turism's blogs and websites, since 2019 the principal turistic states and cities in the United States are: New York State(New York City-Brooklyn),Florida(Orlando-Miami) and California(Los Angeles - San Francisco). On the side we can also find Arizona, Nevada(Las Vegas), Washignton DC, Masachusets(Boston), Texas(Houston) and Kansas City (Misuri). According to the aforementioned, We are going to focus on the states and counties with the objective of having information groups with better aggregates of places that can accomplish the exposed conditions for those.

## **Work Methodology** 

- As a group we decided to go with the SCRUM work method for a better organization in the activities to do. It is designed to break the whole work into individuals goals completed in a short period of time, these periods are also called 'SPRINTS'. Everyday we would gather in daily meetings that would help us asking our mentor about certain doubts we might have about the assignment.
In our case, these Sprints will have a one week duration each with a presentation of a demo to the Product Owner at the end of every week on fridays.

- For further organization we decided to create a Trello Organization Dashboard that would separate the tasks that we have to do with the ones that are already finished; and we also created a Gantt Diagram that shows the weekly division with the project's SPRINTS full cicle. It is expected for all the participants to use the diagram in order to complete the project's tasks in the rigth order and avoid losing time.
Here there is the diagram.
